{% include definition.html content="A set which does not contain any element is called the _empty set_ or the _null set_ or the _void set_."%}

- The empty set is denoted by the symbol $$\emptyset$$ or $$\{\}$$

{% include illustration.html number="14" content="We can write a set as follows:

$$A=\{x \colon \;x \text{ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI}\}$$

We observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set $$A$$ is an _empty set_ as it contains no element at all."%}
{% include illustration.html number="15" content="Let $$B=\{x \colon\;1 \lt x \lt 2,\;x\text{ is a natural number}\}$$. Then $$B$$ is the _empty set_, because there is no natural number between $$1$$ and $$2$$."%}
{% include illustration.html number="16" content="Let $$C=\{x \colon\;1 \lt x \lt 2,\;x\text{ is a natural number}\}$$. Then $$C$$ is the _empty set_, because there is no natural number between $$1$$ and $$2$$."%}
{% include illustration.html number="17" content="Let $$D=\{x \colon\;1 \lt x \lt 2,\;x\text{ is a natural number}\}$$. Then $$D$$ is the _empty set_, because there is no natural number between $$1$$ and $$2$$."%}
