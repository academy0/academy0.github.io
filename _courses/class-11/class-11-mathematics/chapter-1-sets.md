## 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction

Set theory is a fundamental theory in mathematics. It is used in almost every branch of mathematics. It is created by German mathematician [Georg Cantor (1845-1918)][georg-cantor].

## 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets and their Representations

### Sets

##### **Definition**

###### _A set is a well defined collection of objects._

A _collection_ is a group of objects or things, for example, a pack of cards, a cricket team, a toy set, etc. In mathematics also, we have collections of - natural numbers, prime numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, etc.

A _well defined_ collection is a collection for which we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to it or not. If a collection is not _well defined_ the criteria for deciding whether the object belongs to the collection or not may vary from person to person.

**Notes:**

- _Objects, elements_ and _members_ of a set are synonymous terms.
- Sets are usually denoted by capital letters $$A, B, C, X, Y, Z,$$ etc.
- The elements of a set are represented by small letters $$a, b, c, x, y, z,$$ etc.
- $$a \in A$$ denotes "$$a$$ belongs to $$A$$", which means $$a$$ is an element (or object or member) of set $$A$$. The Greek symbol $$\in$$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase '_belongs to_'.
- $$a \notin A$$ denotes "$$a$$ does not belong to $$A$$", which means $$a$$ is not an element of set $$A$$. Symbol $$\notin$$ is used to denote the phrase '_belongs to_'.

**Example 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of odd natural numbers less than 10**  
This is a _well defined_ collection therefore a **Set**. We can definitely find all the odd natural numbers less than 10. The set can be described as $$\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$

**Example 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of continents of the world**  
This is a _well defined_ collection therefore a **Set**. We can definitely list all the continents of the world. The set can be described as \$\$\{Africa, Antartica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America\}.

**Example 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of the solution of the equation: $$x^2-5x+6=0$$**  
This is a _well defined_ collection therefore a **Set**. We can definitely find the solution for this equation. The set can be described as \$\$\{2, 3\}.

**Example 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of the good cricket players**  
This is not a _well defined_ collection. The criterion _good cricket player_ is vague and can vary from person to person. For one person, the collection can be: $$\{$$**Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Mohd Shami**$$\}$$, and for another person it can be - $$\{$$**Dale Steyn, Steven Smith, Jasprit Bumrah**$$\}$$. Therefore, it is not a **Set**.

**Example 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of the vowels in the English alphabet**  
This is a _well defined_ collection therefore a **Set**. We can definitely list all the vowels in the English alphabet. The set can be described as $$\{a, e, i, o, u\}$$.

**Example 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of the prime numbers less than 10**  
This is a _well defined_ collection therefore a **Set**. The set $$P$$ of prime number less than 10 can be described as $$P = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$$.

We see that for all natural numbers less that 10 - $$2 \in P, 3 \in P, 5 \in P$$ and $$7 \in P$$. However, $$1 \notin P, 4 \notin P, 6 \notin P, 8 \notin P$$ and $$9 \notin P$$
