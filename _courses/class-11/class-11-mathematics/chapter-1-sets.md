### 1. Introduction
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

### 2. Sets and their Representations
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

### 3. The Empty Set
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

### 4. Finite and Infinite Sets
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

### 5. Equaly Sets
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

### 6. Subsets
```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

### 7. Power Set
When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to 

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

 and they are 

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

### 8. Universal Set
### 9. Venn Diagram
### 10. Operations of a Set
### 11. Complement of a Set
### 12. Practical Problems on Union and Intersection of Two Sets
